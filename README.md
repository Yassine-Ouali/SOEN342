# Description 

This project is about a food delivery app called "YumYumExpress"! We are aiming to design a new delivery app along the lines of something like "UberEats" while enhancing/creating our own features on top of it.

# Objective 

The objective of this project is to firstly to elicit the necessary requirements and specifications that this delivery app must satisfy. This is done through research of existing products, analysis of existing documented research and a survey we designed ourselves. These three techniques allow us to get the heart of what our customers want from our app.

# Core Features

* User profiles - When you sign up for the service, you can configure many different parts of your profile to customize your experience on the app. In addition, you can add dietary information such as your allergies or any dietary restrictions you have.
* Restaurant browsing - Our home page will recommend you nearby restaurants based on your profile as well as your previous order history. If you're feeling adventurous, you can search through the different restaurants that are available in your area as well.
* Order tracking - Users must be able to see where their food is from when it is prepared to when it reaches their door.
* Loyalty system - Our app rewards you for every time you use it for your orders, the more frequent, the more you're rewarded.
* Reviews - Leave reviews for the restaurants you order from and the delivery drivers who bring you your food.
